### Background

During the period of May 7-13, 2021, Tajikistan experienced a series of floods, mudflows and mass
movements, which led to deaths and damages to buildings and infrastructure. While the
Government of Tajikistan has requested international assistance to respond to and recover from
these disasters, they were not considered to be significant enough to declare a national emergency.
They do, however, reflect the kind of local and recurrent events that are common and likely
increasingly frequent in the country, undermining sustainable development.

The World Bank is currently implementing the Strengthening Critical Infrastructure against Natural
Hazards Project (SCINHP) and is preparing the Tajikistan Resilient Landscape Restoration Project
(TRELLIS), Tajikistan Resilient Irrigation Project (TRIP), and the Fifth Phase of the Central Asia
Regional Links Program (CARs-5). In addition, the potential of a 2nd phase of SCINHP is being
explored. All of these projects will seek, through varying approaches and with different sectoral
investment targets, to increase the resilience of Tajikistan against hydrometeorological hazards such
as those experienced in May 2021.

Within this framework, a forensic assessment of the May 7- 13 disaster has been undertaken by the
University of Zurich (UZH), Switzerland and the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research
(SLF), Davos, Switzerland, that is presented in this report. The overarching objective of this study is
to perform a primarily remote-based assessment of the processes that led to the May 2021 disaster;
assess how extreme the processes that led to this disasters are in the current climatic context; and
evaluate the possible impacts of future climatic changes for the frequency and magnitude of such
events in the future.
