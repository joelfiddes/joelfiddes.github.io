I aim to combine field measurements, climate datasets and modelling tools to solve real-world problems related to climate change and its impact in mountain and other remote regions. I have experience in academic and applied sectors. Currently [2017-2018] I have a research grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation and working on assimilating satellite data into numerical models.
