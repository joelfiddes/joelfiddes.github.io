I am a geoscientist with over 15 years of experience working with international organizations, multilateral donors and UN bodies as a consultant. My main research interest is on high mountain processes related to natural hazards and water resources. I use and develop geoscientific models and other datascience tools in combination with field campaigns to understand these processes and aid the development of operational tools.

I am currently working in Tajikistan together with the Tajik Hydromet, Ministry of Energy and Water on high mountain issues and have recently established a Permafrost measurement network in the Zerafshan range together with Tajik partners. I also work with the WMO Global Cryospahere Watch as an expert on operational data exchange. 

## Short bio
- PhD Subgrid numerical land surface modelling, University of Zurich.

- BSc Environmental sciences, University of Aberdeen.


## Research focus
- High mountain processes under a changing climate.
- Application of numerical land surface models in remote areas.
- Subgrid processes.
- Downscaling global climate datasets in complex terrain.
- Assimilation of observations in to the modelling process.
- Field measurements in tough locations.
- From sensors to decision making.
